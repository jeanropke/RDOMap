[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/HkU6ugT) to report issues for specific collectables, collaborate with other contributors, ask questions about the map, and talk with translators.

Savvy with a language that the language doesn't have yet? See something that isn't quite translated correctly? Feel free to contribute to the translation of any language by heading over to the [Crowdin project page](https://crowdin.com/project/rdr2rdomap) for the map.

Also see our other map for Red Dead Online collector content, for all of the collector role's item locations:

Donations are always appreciated. Find the donations link at the bottom of the menu.
